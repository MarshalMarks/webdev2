# Web Development 2 (Javascript) Example Website

## Info

This is the example webpage written for the Web Development 2 workshop given at the UTA Central Library on September 26th.

Feel free to download the files and mess around with them to get a better understanding of Javascript. Maybe try adding new mechanics to the game or new visual elements!

As a reminder: HTML, CSS, and Javascript files can be opened in any plaintext editor or IDE (integrated development environment).

## Basic Setup Instructions

1. Download the zip file from the GitHub page or clone the directory to your local machine.
2. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
3. Right click on index.html, go to 'Open With', and click on your web browser of choice.

## More Learning Resources

This workshop should act as a springboard to lay down the basics of Javascript, but there is so much more that I was not able to cover in an hour. Here are some additional resources to use if you'd like to learn more:
